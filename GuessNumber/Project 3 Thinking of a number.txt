Project #3 

M256 Computer Programming 

I’m thinking of a number … 

 

Using HTML and JavaScript, write a program that will generate a random integer between 1 and 100 then 
have the user guess the number. Give clues to help the user guess. 

 

Specific Requirements: 

 

1. On the web page, include the following: 


 

a. Clear instructions for the user on how to play the game. 


 

b. A button for the user to click to start the game. 


 

c. A button for the user to click to check his guess for the current round. 


 

d. A button for the user to start the game over (use a confirm box). Be sure to reset 
all values (including totals). 


 

e. A textbox to display the number of guesses in the current round. 


 

f. A textbox to display the number of rounds played. 


 

g. A textbox to display the number of rounds won. 


 

h. A textbox to display the average number of tries it takes the user to guess the 
number correctly. 


 

2. Do all processing in functions. 


 

3. Generate a random integer between 1 and 100 for the user to guess. 


 

4. If the user guesses the correct number, display an appropriate ‘congratulations’ 
message and update all totals accordingly. 


 

5. If the user guesses incorrectly, display an appropriate message to tell the user to 
guess higher or lower the next time, then update all totals accordingly. 


 

6. Only allow 6 guesses (if the user is wrong on the 6th guess, he ‘loses’ the game). 


 

7. When the user ‘wins’, automatically generate a new number to play again (be sure to 
clear the ‘number of guesses’ textbox and any necessary variables). Let the user 
know a new round has been started. 


 

8. For each round, keep track of the number of times the user guesses and display this in 
the appropriate textbox. 


 

9. Throughout the game, keep track of and display an average number of tries it takes 
the person to guess correctly. 


 

10. Display the number of rounds the player has won in the appropriate textbox. 


 

11. Include appropriate comments in your source code. 


 

 

 

 

 

 


 

Possible enhancements: 

-Don’t let the user guess the same number twice (alert them that they’ve already guessed that 
number) 

-Custom buttons 

-Use innerHTML instead of textboxes to display the results for the game 

-Other ideas???
