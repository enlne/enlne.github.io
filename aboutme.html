Hello!

<br/><br/>

I am currently a student at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, majoring in computer science. I'm still exploring my interests in this field. I'm currently taking two computer science, one linear algebra, and one creative writing classes. 

<br/><br/>

I like to read, play video and board games, draw/paint/crafts, and write. I've written a few books (with the help of <a href=http://www.nanowrimo.org>NaNoWriMo</a> - National Novel Writing Month). So I spend a lot of time creating characters, creating worlds, planning plots, drawing characters and places, researching everything on Google, and of course, actually writing the books. 

<br/><br/>

My current writing projects are a rewrite of my Nano2013 book and preparation for Nano2016. My current programming project is this website. 

<br/><br/>

The second part of the password is E

<br/><br/>

Hint: my favorite number is 12.
