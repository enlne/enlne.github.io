I am currently a student at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, majoring in computer science. I'm still exploring my interests in this field; right now I like making games. I'm currently taking computer science, chemistry, calculus, and linguistics classes.

When I get free time I like to read books, play video games, draw/paint/crafts, and write. I've written a few books (with the help of NaNoWriMo - National Novel Writing Month). So I tend to spend time creating characters, creating worlds, planning plots, drawing characters and places, researching everything on Google, and of course, actually writing the books.
