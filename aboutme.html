I'm Ellen Ni, a current student at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. I'm majoring in computer science and still exploring my interests in this field.  

<br/><br/>

I'm a writer, reader, artist, programmer. I've written a few books (with the help of <a href=http://www.nanowrimo.org>NaNoWriMo</a> - National Novel Writing Month). This entails creating characters, creating worlds, plotting plots, drawing characters and places, researching anything on Google, and of course, actually writing the books. 

<br/><br/>

My current writing projects are a rewrite of my Nano2013 book and preparation for Nano2016. My current programming projects are this website and a choose your own adventure game.
